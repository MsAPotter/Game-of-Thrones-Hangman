Hurdle #1:  Bootstrap doesn't play well with others. I tried using Bootstrap for the styling of the buttons, using cards and putting them in a container, but I couldn't adjust the spacing to use the full horizontal space. I finally had to abandon bootstrap and build it with HTML and CSS.

Hurdle #2: While I successfully was able to make a for loop that listened for the button A and console-logged "yes" when it matched a letter of the phrase, and "no" when it didn't match; I am having trouble making a loop that listens for all the buttons and does the same thing.
